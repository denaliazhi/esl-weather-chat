### 👩🏻‍💻 Technical details
This app was my submission for the [Weather App Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) in TOP's[^1] Fullstack Javascript path

#### Premise
Create an app that allows users to get weather data from an API. The premise was pretty basic, so I tailored my app to be more useful for ESL learners. I based the material on questions I used to ask my students as a volunteer ESL teacher.

|Language or Library | Concepts |
|---------| ---------|
| `Javascript` | API<br>Asynchronous code |
  
👀 Please see my [commit history](https://github.com/denaliazhi/esl-weather-chat/commits/main/) for details on my problem-solving process

#### 🔨 Enhancements
If I were to revisit this project at a later date, I'd want to tackle the following:
- Add a translation feature
- Allow user to respond to each question via multiple choice menu
- Provide feedback on whether the user's response is right or wrong
- Use AI or an API for more dynamic conversations / adapting grammar to a broader date range (currently, variations in verb tense are hard coded)
